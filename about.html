      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <h6>BcS in Software Design Through Cloud Computing</h6>
        <p>I studied in Athlone Institute of technology between 2014 and 2018.
          During my time in AIT I studied langauges such as Java, C#, PHP and JavaScript. We also covered aspects of
          software engineering such as development lifecycles and design methodologies as well as what to expect in
          industry as an employee and independent developer under law and ethical responsibility.

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>Sportlomo</h3>
        <h6>Junior Back-end Developer</h6>
        <p>During my placement at Sportlomo as a junior PHP developer I learned many vital skills that I will
          continue to use during my career and saw how some of what I learned through study was applicable in industry.
          For instance it was my first time using a linux operating system and interacting with git
          through the command line.

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Cerner</h3>
        <h6>Software Engineer</h6>
        <p>
          I've had a fantastic time working at Cerner in the Population Health organisation thus far, 
          it's a large company that does an incredible amount in terms of data processing and product delivery.
          During my time I've been exposed to more angles of software than I could ever type into this paragraph but also I've had the opportunity 
          to develop a deep knowledge of the technologies with which I contributed to our products such as ruby through developing APIs with rails and grape.
